# Project-Bank-System
A simple Bank Management System in C++ using OOP and file handling. Features include account creation, balance check, deposit, withdrawal, modify/delete account, and admin access to account details.

💳 Simple Bank Management System in C++
This project is a basic Bank Management System built using C++. It is a console-based application that simulates simple banking operations and demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming, file handling, and user interaction through menus.

🔧 Features
The system provides the following functionalities:

Create New Account – Allows users to create a new bank account.

Check Account Balance – Lets users check the balance of their existing account.

Deposit Cash – Users can deposit money into their accounts.

Withdraw Cash – Withdraw funds from an account after verifying the balance.

Modify Account Details – Change or update personal/account information.

Delete Account – Permanently remove an account from the system.

Admin Access to Account Details – Admins can view full details of all accounts.

Exit Option – Exit the banking system safely.

🛠️ Technologies Used
C++ (Core language)

OOP Concepts (Classes and Objects)

File Handling (to store account data)

🎯 Purpose
This project is ideal for beginners learning C++ and looking to understand how to build real-world applications using basic programming concepts. It gives hands-on experience with menu-driven interfaces and file operations in C++.

📂 How It Works
All user and account data is stored in a file.

Users interact with the system through numeric input (1 to 8).

Admin access can be restricted based on conditions (e.g., password check – to be implemented manually if needed).

✅ Future Improvements
Add password protection for admin features.

Improve user interface with colors or GUI libraries.

Use a database for better data management.

📌 Note
This is a basic offline application and doesn’t connect to any real banking network. It’s made purely for learning and demonstration purposes.
